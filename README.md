# 20-Development-CI-CD

### Description
I created a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run the component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, and the application is deployed when code is merged from develop to the main branch. I was able to use Github actions to deploy when the code is merged from the develop to the main branch. I was not able to use Github actions to run the component test via Cypress. I worked on this assigment in tutoring session and also worked with my TA and Instructor to fix the error message that I consistently get when I ren the Cypress component test action. I have been consistently getting the error message 'Could not find Cypress test run results'. However, I am able to run the component test locally.
